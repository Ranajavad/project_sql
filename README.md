Data Analyst Job Market Analysis (SQL Project)

This project uses SQL to analyze the data analyst job market and extract insights about salaries, skill demand, and skill requirements for high-paying roles. The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used as an analytical and business intelligence tool, not just for data retrieval.


Questions answered in this project

What I used

SQL with relational databases, including joins between fact and dimension tables (job_postings_fact, company_dim, skills_dim, skills_job_dim). The project applies filtering, sorting, aggregation, grouping, CTEs, null handling, and structured query design to solve real analytical questions.

What I learned

I learned how to translate business and market questions into SQL logic, how to work with relational data models, and how to structure queries for clarity and scalability. I also developed a stronger understanding of analytical thinking in SQL by connecting job roles, salaries, and skills into meaningful insights instead of isolated queries. This project strengthened my ability to use SQL as a decision-support and analysis tool rather than just a querying language.
