Data Analyst Job Market Analysis (SQL Project)

This project uses SQL to analyze the data analyst job market and extract insights about salaries, skill demand, and skill requirements for high-paying roles. The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used as an analytical and business intelligence tool, not just for data retrieval.

Questions answered in this project

What are the top-paying remote data analyst jobs?
What are the most in-demand skills for data analysts in Norway?
What skills are required for the highest-paying data analyst roles?

What I used

SQL with relational databases, including joins between fact and dimension tables (job_postings_fact, company_dim, skills_dim, skills_job_dim). The project applies filtering, sorting, aggregation, grouping, CTEs, null handling, and structured query design to solve real analytical questions.

What I learned

I learned how to translate business and market questions into SQL logic, how to work with relational data models, and how to structure queries for clarity and scalability. I also developed a stronger understanding of analytical thinking in SQL by connecting job roles, salaries, and skills into meaningful insights instead of isolated queries. This project strengthened my ability to use SQL as a decision-support and analysis tool rather than just a querying language.
